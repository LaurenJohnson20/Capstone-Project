The world famous New York institution of the \"Delicatessen,\" commonly referred to as a \"Deli,\" was originally an institution of the city's Jewry. Much of New York City's Jewish fare has become popular around the globe, especially bagels. (New York City's Jewish community is also famously fond of Chinese food, and many members of this community think of it as their second ethnic cuisine).\n\nLike the Askenazi-Jewish community, another cuisine usually associated with New York City stems in part from its large community of Italian-Americans and their descendants. Much of New York City's Italian fare has become popular around the globe, especially New York-style pizza.\n\nBesides Pizzeria's, cafe's, dinner's, and many standalone ethnic specfic restauraunts, there is also a market for street food and mobile food vendors.\n\nThe city is home to \"nearly one thousand of the finest and most diverse haute cuisine restaurants in the world\", according to Michelin.\n\nSo it is obvious that to survive in such a fiercely competitive market, it is very important to startegically plan and carefully decide on what type of bussiness to open and where to open it.\n\nVarious factors need to be studied in-order to decide on the Location such as:\n\n1. New York Population\n2. New York City Demographics\n3. Who are the competitors in that location?\n4. Cuisine served / Menu of the competitors\n5. Segmentation of the Borough\n6. Untapped markets\n7. Saturated markets, etc\n\nThe list can go on...\n\n"
